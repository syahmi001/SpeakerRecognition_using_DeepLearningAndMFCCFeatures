# SpeakerRecognition_using_MachineLearningAndMFCCFeatures
 Using Machine Learning method and MFCC features extraction to recognize a speaker through the training samples and validation.
 
 10 speakers are selected to voice over the same sample text and 6 samples are taken from each of them.
 The sample words are "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
 5 samples are used for training and 1 sample is used for validation/test.
 
 The voices of each of the speakers are pre-processed and converted to a form that can be used for the machine learning modules.
 The method used is MFCC (Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients) to extract the spectrum range of the voices. Euclidean distance
 is used to find the "owner" of the voices.
 
 The results are as below:-
